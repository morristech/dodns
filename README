Dynamic DNS with Digital Ocean

Have a domain set up using Digital Ocean nameservers.
Have an API key exported as DIGITAL_OCEAN_API.

OSX:

    * Use launchd to trigger update when network location changes:

        /path/to/dodns DOMAIN SUBDOMAIN plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/location_change.plist
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/location_change.plist # or logout/login

LINUX:

    * Use network manager to update when network location changes:

        /path/to/dodns DOMAIN SUBDOMAIN nm > /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99ddns
        chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99ddns

    * Use cron to check/update on a fixed schedule (lame):

        */15 * * * * /path/to/dodns DOMAIN SUBDOMAIN ddns
